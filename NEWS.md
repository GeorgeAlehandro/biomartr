biomartr 0.2.0
===========

In this version, `biomartr` was extended to retrieve genome, proteome, CDS, and meta-genome data
from [ENSEMBL](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) and [ENSEMLGENOMES](http://ensemblgenomes.org/).
Furthermore, all NCBI retrieval functions were updated to the new server folder structure standards of NCBI.


### New Functions

- new meta-retrieval function `meta.retrieval.all()` allows users to download all individual genomes of all kingdoms of life with one command

- new metagenome retrieval function `getMetaGenomes()` allows users to retrieve metagenomes from NCBI Genbank

- new metagenome retrieval function `getMetaGenomeAnnotations()` allows users to retrieve annotation files for genomes belonging to a metagenome project stored at NCBI Genbank

- new database retrieval function `download.database.all()` allows users to download entire NCBI databases with one command

- new function `listMetaGenomes()` allowing users to list available metagenomes on NCBI Genbank

- new external helper function `getSummaryFile()` to retrieve the assembly_summary.txt file from NCBI

- new external helper function `getKingdomAssemblySummary()` to retrieve the assembly_summary.txt files from NCBI for all kingdoms and combine them
into one big data.frame

- new external helper function `getMetaGenomeSummary()` to retrieve the assembly_summary.txt files from NCBI genbank metagenomes

- new internal helper function `getENSEMBL.Seq()` acting as main interface function to communicate with the ENSEMBL database API

- new internal helper function `get.ensemblgenome.info()` to retrieve general organism information from ENSEMLGENOMES 

### Function changes

- the functions `getGenome()`, `getProteome()`, and `getCDS()` were completely re-written and now use the assembly_summary.txt files
provided by NCBI to retrieve the download path to the corresponding genome. Furthermore, these functions now lost the `kingdom` argument.
Users now only need to specify the organism name and not the kingdom anymore. Furthermore, all `get*` functions now
return the path to the downloaded genome so that this path can be used as input to all `read_*` functions.

- `download_databases()` has been renamed to `download.databases()` to be more consistent with other function notation

- the argument `db_format` was removed from `listDatabases()` and `download.database()` because it was misleading

- the command `listDatabases("all")` now returns all available NCBI databases that can be retrieved with `download.database()`

- `download_database()` now internally checks if input database specified by the user is actually available on NCBI servers

- the documentary file generated by `getGenome()`, `getProteome()`, and `getCDS()` is now extended to store more details about the downloaded genome

- argument `database` in `is.genome.available()` and `listGenomes()` has been renamed to `db` to be consistent with all other sequence retrieval functions

- `is.genome.available()` now also checks availability of organisms in ENSEMBL. See `db = "ensembl"`

- the argument `db_name` in `listDatabases()` has been renamed `db` to be more consistent with the notation in other functions

- the argument `name` in `download.database()` has been renamed `db` to be more consistent with the notation in other functions

- `getKingdoms()` received new argument `db` to specify from which database (e.g. `refseq` or `genbank`) kingdom information shall be retrieved

- `getKingdoms(db = "refseq")` received one more member: `"viral"`

- argument `out.folder` in `meta.retrieval()` has been renamed to `path` to be more consistent with other retrieval functions


### Vignette updates

- new Vignette `Meta-Genome Retrieval`
- Update examples and extend `Database Retrieval` Vignette 
- Update examples and extend `Sequence Retrieval` Vignette





biomartr 0.1.0
===========

- fixing a parsing error of the file `ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/assembly_summary.txt`
The problem was that comment lines were introduced and columns couldn't be parsed correctly anymore. This caused that genomes, proteomes, and CDS files could not be downloaded properly. This has been fixed now.

- genomes, proteome, and CDS as well as meta-genomes can now be retrieved
from RefSeq and Genbank (not only RefSeq); only `getCDS()` does not have genebank access,
becasue genbank does not provide CDS sequences

- adding new function `meta.retrieval()` to mass retrieve genomes for entire kingdoms of life 

- fixed a major bug in `organismBM()` causing the function to fail. The failure of
this function affected all downstream `organism*()` functions. Bug is now fixed and everything
works properly

- updated Vignettes

biomartr 0.0.3
===========

- updating unit tests for new API

- fixing API problems that caused all BioMart related functions to fail

- fixing retrieval problems in `getCDS()`, `getProteome()`, and `getGenome()`

- the `listDatabases()` function now has a new option `db_name = "all"` allowing users to list all available databases stored on NCBI 

### Vignettes
- adding new vignette: Database Retrieval
- update the vignettes: Phylotranscriptomics, Sequence Retrieval, and Functional Annotation
